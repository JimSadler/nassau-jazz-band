        <v-col><h2>History</h2>

          <p>Created in 2004 as a local chapter of the "New Horizons Band", a group of adults connected with the Amelia
            Arts
            Academy started rehearsing at the Peck Community Center. With a seasonal membership of 20 musicians, the
            group
            quickly became known for offering free concerts and a relaxed rehearsal experience for persons reuniting
            with
            their instruments.
            The closing of the Amelia Arts Academy resulted in the restructuring of the group and the "Nassau Community
            Band" was formed in 2012. A membership roster of 40 to 50 musicians of all ages (currently 14 to 87 years
            young)
            that come from all walks of life, military, business owners, medical professionals, factory workers, music
            educators, college students, and folks who love playing concert band music.
            Now a multi-generational ensemble, the group is recognized for a repertoire of classics, pops, marches,
            audience
            sing-a-longs, movie medleys, and the unexpected. We perform in various locations in the North East Florida
            area
            for a variety of events. One of our big concerts of the year is the annual Fourth of July Concert in
            Historic
            Downtown Fernandina Beach, culminating with Fireworks. We also play at the annual Christmas Tree lighting
            and
            the Dickens on Centre festival. Throughout the year the Nassau Community Band can be seen around the
            area.</p></v-col>
